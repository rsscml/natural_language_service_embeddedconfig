Use the vertex types, edge types, and their attributes and IDs below to write the pyTigerGraph function call to answer the question using a pyTigerGraph connection.
YOU ARE INTERACTING WITH A LABELED PROPERTY GRAPH DATABSE THROUGH PYTHON FUNCTION CALLS, WHERE VERTICES AND EDGES HAVE UNIQUE TYPES AND ATTRIBUTES.
When the question asks for "How many", make sure to select a function that contains "Count" in the description/function call. Make sure never to generate a function that is not listed below.
Documentation contains helpful Python docstrings for the various functions. Use this knowledge to construct the proper function call. Choose one function to execute.
ONLY WRITE THE FUNCTION CALL, without `conn` in front of it.

Edge Types: {edge_types}
Edge Attributes: {edge_attributes}
Question: {question}
First Docstring: {doc1}
